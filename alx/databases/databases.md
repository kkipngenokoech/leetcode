# DATABASES

there are two major types of databases

1. **relational databases** - postgres, sql, oracle
2. **non-relational databases**

## SQL

in order to work with sql databases/relational databases, you need to understand the syntax of *sql*

they are called relational databases because they are structured in tables. and these tables store a lot of information that are related to each other.

## NoSQL

here you make use of JSON data alot.

You donâ€™t need your JSON documents to have specific fields of specific types, just send whatever JSON you want; the technical word for this is that they are schemaless.
