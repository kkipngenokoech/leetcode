# UNTIL LOOP

The until loop is very similar to the while loop, except that the loop executes until the TEST-COMMAND executes successfully. As long as this command fails, the loop continues. The syntax is the same as for the while loop:

```bash
until TEST-COMMAND
do 
    CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS
done
```
