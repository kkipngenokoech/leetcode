# PUPPET

this is an open source configuration management tool

Puppet is designed to help automate the management and configuration of software and infrastructure. It allows you to define the desired state of your systems and applications using a declarative language. With Puppet, you can define configurations, policies, and dependencies for your software and infrastructure components. These configurations can be version-controlled and tested, allowing for consistent and reproducible deployments.
