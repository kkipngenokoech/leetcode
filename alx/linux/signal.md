# SIGNAL

A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.

A signal is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly

there are two types of signals:

1. Maskable - signals which can be changed or ignored by the user
2. Non-maskable - signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user

if you want to see all signals present in a linux system you run the command `man 7 signal`
